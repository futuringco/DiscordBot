# DiscordBot
Simple Discord Bot Bootstrap

This bootstrap has the only utils if you want to write from zero a Discord bot.

The requirements are just few:
1) Create a new application from here https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/
2) Create a Bot from the "Bot" tab on the left
3) Invite your brand new bot from a link similar to this https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<Bot_Client_ID>&scope=bot&permissions=0
Please note that the client id is generated by discord and is in the "General Information" tab and the permission value is in the "Bot" tab (8 for Administrator)
4) Copy your bot token and insert it in a .env file or just insert in the ".env_example" file and rename it

It's done, your bot is ready! Navigate the folder with your Terminal (or PowerShell) and run:
```
node bot.js
```
